/**
 * @description
 * A statemap is an object where keys are state names, and values are default values.
 * for simplicity, this library expects that all states are objects
 * if you have a list of books, index them on an ID field, or create one from the index.
 *
 * With the exception of functions,
 * stateMap treats the keys of your object as resources in the redux store and creates
 * corresponding setter and updater reducers and action creators for each.
 * For example, from {cat: "meow"} you get actions:
 *  - setCat(),
 *  - updateCat()
 * and reducers for types "SET_CAT", and "UPDATE_CAT"
 *
