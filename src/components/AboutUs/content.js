          OpenLearn is a free learning platform, delivered by The Open
          University as part of its Royal Charter commitment to support the
          wellbeing of the community.

          Since its launch in 2006, OpenLearn has become an integrated part of
          The Open University, with the site attracting almost 75 million
          visitors – many of which go on to make an enquiry about becoming a
          formal student, strengthening the journey between informal and formal
          learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OpenLearn team originate, commission and develop content that
          unites faculty and University priorities with areas of topical and
          general interest. This is in support of our own student population in
          their academic, skills and career and personal development (CPD)
          endeavours, delivering quality assets openly available for teaching
          and learning.
