# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run, `cd` into the directory, then execute either:

`yarn && yarn start` if you have yarn installed,

or

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

to develop with npm.

Your server should run be running locally on http://localhost:3000

# CSS

Please use [tachyons](tachyons.io) classes for styling. See

# Linting

I've set up Prettier as a pre-commit hook. I recommend using it on save as well.
